## Introduction

There are a lot of meme subreddits in Reddit. However, using reddit for meme browsing is not everyone's priority.
So that's why I created [**Memerize**](https://github.com/SuhasDissa/MemerizeApp).
An app dedicated for browsing reddit memes. With a clutter free, easy to navigate interface.
