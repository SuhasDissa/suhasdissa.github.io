So I made this short 3D film called "Sakura" using Blender. It started out as just a teaser video for the **Sakura Musical Event** that our Computer Science department at University of Moratuwa put together for their 40th anniversary. But it kind of took on a life of its own as I was making it.

## What happens in the film

### First part
There's an old man walking through a forest at night, holding up a lantern to light his way. He's heading to a river where he left his boat. When he gets there, he carefully puts his lantern in the boat and pushes off into the water.
### Middle bit
Now he's floating down this river that winds through a really dense forest. At one point, he pulls out this cloth he's been carrying. It's got a drawing of a sakura tree on it – that's what he's looking for. Then he keeps going, drifting along the water.
### Final part
He finally reaches some land and starts hiking up this hill. When he gets to the top – there it is! The sakura tree from his drawing. He's totally blown away by it. He sits down underneath all those pink blossoms and starts playing this melody on his mandolin. Then the camera moves around to show what he's seeing – this incredible view that looks like something out of a dream.

## What we were trying to say
I didn't want to make it too obvious, but there are some simple symbols in there:

- The man is kind of like anyone coming to watch the event
- The sakura tree represents the event itself
- And that amazing view at the end? That's about all the students working together, creating something beautiful through collaboration

## The message

> Paradise lies within; in timeless, tender hopes.

*In other words, you don't need to go searching far away for your paradise. It's already inside you and around you when you open yourself up to it.*
