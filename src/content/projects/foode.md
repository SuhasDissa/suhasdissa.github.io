## Introduction

The [International Numbering System for Food Additives
(INS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Numbering_System_for_Food_Additives)
is a naming system for food additives. When any food additives are added
to a product during the manufacturing process, the INS numbers
corresponding to these additives can be seen on the product's ingredient
list. These numbers are usually prefixed with **INS** or **E**(Hence
these numbers are also called as [E
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_number))

For the consumer's to find the exact ingredients used in a product, they
will have to look up these E-numbers, which can be a tiresome and
frustrating process. So, In order to simplify this process, I made the
[**Food-E App**](https://github.com/SuhasDissa/Food-E-App).

## App Features

As I said above, the main goal of this app is to provide you an easy to
access, comprehensive database of food additives. I've added almost all
the additives and a short description for each additive. At the time of
writing, this app contains more than 560 additives.

This app offers a search bar that you can use to search additives by the
number or the name.

After publishing this app on GitHub, I received a lot of useful
suggestions to improve the app experience.
One of which was adding halal
status for each additive.

## Barcode scanner

I initially wanted this app to be simple, and do what it said, without
any additional features. However, I changed my mind after getting a
bunch of requests to add a barcode scanner to this app.

Now you can use this app to search for products using the open food
facts database. You can scan barcodes and get information about the food
product.
